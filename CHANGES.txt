0.6.8 - January 28, 2009
	New method added to RSolr::Connection::Base - #find_values_for_facet
	This method searches for facet values only, and sets the :rows param to 0
	- returns an RSolr::Response::Query::Base instance
	Example:
		search_params[:facets][:offset]=0
		search_params[:facets][:limit]=5
		response = solr.search_facet_by_name(:language_facet, search_params)

0.6.7 - January 27, 2009
	The Symbol extension in core_ext.rb was cause for some REALLY painful debuging - so I removed it :(
	This means no more :q.alt or :facet.field until RSolr gets a really nice query-builder module happening.

0.6.6 - January 26, 2009
	Added #get method helper to RSolr::Response::Query::DocExt
	# doc.get(key, opts)
	# key is the name of the field
	# opts is a hash with the following valid keys:
	#  - :sep - a string used for joining multivalued field values
	#  - :default - a value to return when the key doesn't exist
	# if :sep is nil and the field is a multivalued field, the array is returned

0.6.5 - January 26, 2009
	Removed to_mash everywhere, except for usage in RSolr::Response
	Added a #close method to the Direct adapter
		- this closes the connection and sets the @connection variable to nil
	Removed to_mash in RSolr::Connection::Base
	Changed RSolr::Response::Query::Doc to DocExt
		- this no longer extends Mash
		- each doc in the response now uses the #extend method to mixin the new DocExt module
	Added #teardown method in direct connection test, this method closes the connection
	Updated the connection test methods a bit

0.6.4 - January 26, 2009
	Updated the mapping output for the :filters and :phrase_filters (when using the #search method)
		- now sending multiple fq's instead of one
	Updated mapping tests

0.6.3 - January 21, 2009
	Added a new param mapping module: RSolr::Connection::ParamMapping
	Mapping only for fields that need conversion/escaping or nested (facet.*) etc.
	This new module can be activated by using the #search method
	New tests for ParamMapping

0.6.2 - January 14, 2009
	Removed mapping and indexer modules -- seems to me that a general purpose mapping library
	would be more valuable than an embedded module in RSolr ( RMapper ?)
	This helps lighten RSolr a bit too
	
0.6.1 - January 13, 2009
	Removed SearchExt and mapping until this library gets some real use
	The only param mapping now is for :page and :per_page via the #search method
	The Connection::Base #query method does NO mapping now
	
0.6.0 - January 9, 2009
	Removed first argument from RSolr.connect, the "adapter_name"
		The adapter is now set using the :adapter key when passing in options to RSolr.connect:
		s = RSolr.connect(:adapter=>:direct)
	
0.5.9 - January 7, 2009
	Finally brought in the ExtLib Mash classes for incoming params and response hashes from solr
	  - this gives the ability to access/set values for hashes using strings OR symbols (HashWithIndifferentAccess)
	Organized response tests
	Added more response tests
	Simplified the RSolr::Response::Base class by supporting only raw/string ruby input
	Added method to Response::IndexInfo for grabbing a Solr field list
	
0.5.7 - January 5, 2009
	Changed name from Solr to RSolr, changed all references to Solr to RSolr
	Added new tests for RSolr::Mapper and RSolr::Message
	
0.5.6 - December 30, 2008
	solr.gemspec cleanedup thanks to shairontoledo on github! :)
	Added Solr::Response::Query::Facet module with helpers from the delsolr project
		Also added test stub in test/connection/search_ext_test_methods.rb
	Fixed pagination math errors
	Added new SearchExt helper field: :phrase_filters
		This will add quoted values to the :filters (fq solr param) hash for doing easier facet requests
	
	Be sure to check out the new demo app: http://github.com/mwmitchell/consuminator/tree/master
	
0.5.5 - December 29, 2008
	Fixed bug where accessing a field by method name failed:
		docs.each do |doc|
			doc.timestamp
		end
	Fixed bug where using the #has? method on a doc failed:
		docs.each do |doc|
			doc.has?('timestamp')
		end
	Removed invalid autoload in Solr module
	Fixed spelling error in Solr::Connection::SearchExt (thanks to matthewrudy)
	
0.5.4 - December 29, 2008
	Re-organized the main Solr adapters, they're now in Solr::Connection::Adapter instead of Solr::Adapter
	All responses from HTTPClient and Connection::Adapter::Direct return a hash with the following keys:
		:status_code
		:body
		:params
		:url
		:path
		:headers
		:data
	This hash is now available in the solr response objects as #source - this will be useful in testing and debugging by allowing you to see the generated params and queries... example:
		response = Solr.query(:q=>'*:*')
		response.source[:params]
		response.source[:body]
		response.source[:url]
	Added MultiValue field support in Solr::Message, thanks to Fouad Mardini
	Bug in Solr::Connection::SearchExt where the :q params was not getting generated - fixed by Fouad Mardini
	Organized tests a bit, moved connection tests into test/connection
	Fixed a bug in Solr::Connection::Adapter::HTTP where invalid HTTP POST headers were being generated
